0,tim mcgraw,"

he said the way my blue eyes shined
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said, ""that's a lie""
just a boy in a chevy truck
that had a tendency of gettin' stuck
on back roads at night
and i was right there beside him all summer long
and then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

but when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me

september saw a month of tears
and thankin' god that you weren't here
to see me like that
but in a box beneath my bed
is a letter that you never read
from three summers back
it's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
and lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me

and i'm back for the first time since then
i'm standin' on your street
and there's a letter left on your doorstep
and the first thing that you'll read is:

when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
someday you'll turn your radio on
i hope it takes you back to that place
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me

oh, think of me
mmmm

he said the way my blue eyes shined
put those georgia stars to shame that night

"
1,picture to burn,"

state the obvious, i didn't get my perfect fantasy
i realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
so go and tell your friends that i'm obsessive and crazy
[album version line:] that's fine i'll tell mine that you're gay!
[music video version line:] that's fine you won't mind if i say
by the way...

[chorus:]
i hate that stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak
who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned you're
just another picture to burn!

there's no time for tears,
i'm just sitting here planning my revenge
there's nothing stopping me
from going out with all of your best friends
and if you come around saying sorry to me
my daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[chorus]

and if you're missing me,
you'd better keep it to yourself
'cause coming back around here
would be bad for your health...

'cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak
who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
in case you haven't heard,
i really really hate that...

[chorus]

burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
you're just another picture to burn
baby, burn...
"
2,teardrops on my guitar,"

drew looks at me.
i fake a smile so he won't see
that i want and i'm needing
everything that we should be.

i'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about,
and she's got everything that i have to live without.

drew talks to me.
i laugh 'cause it's just so funny
that i can't even see
anyone when he's with me.

he says he's so in love, he's finally got it right.
i wonder if he knows he's all i think about at night.

he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star.
he's the song in the car i keep singing. don't know why i do.

drew walks by me.
can he tell that i can't breathe?
and there he goes, so perfectly.
the kind of flawless i wish i could be.

she better hold him tight, give him all her love,
look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star.
he's the song in the car i keep singing. don't know why i do.

so, i drive home alone.
as i turn out the light
i'll put his picture down
and maybe get some sleep tonight.

'cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.
the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart.
he's the song in the car i keep singing. don't know why i do.

he's the time taken up, but there's never enough.
and he's all that i need to fall into.

drew looks at me.
i fake a smile so he won't see.
"
3,a place in this world,"

i don't know what i want, so don't ask me
cause i'm still trying to figure it out
don't know what's down this road, i'm just walking
trying to see through the rain coming down
even though i'm not the only one
who feels the way i do

[chorus:]
i'm alone, on my own, and that's all i know
i'll be strong, i'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
oh, i'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

got the radio on, my old blue jeans
and i'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
could you tell me what more do i need
and tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
but that's ok

[chorus]

maybe i'm just a girl on a mission
but i'm ready to fly

i'm alone, on my own, and that's all i know
i'll be strong, i'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
oh i'm alone, on my own, and that's all i know
oh i'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

oh i'm just a girl
oh i'm just a girl, oh, oh,
oh i'm just a girl
"
4,cold as you,"

you have a way of coming easily to me
and when you take, you take the very best of me
so i start a fight 'cause i need to feel something
and you do what you want 'cause i'm not what you wanted

oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through
i've never been anywhere cold as you

you put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
and i stood there loving you and wished them all away
and you come away with a great little story
of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
so, just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through
i've never been anywhere cold as you

you never did give a damn thing, honey, but i cried, cried for you
and i know you wouldn't have told nobody if i died, died for you, died for you

oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made
and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through
i've never been anywhere cold as you
"
5,the outside,"

i didn't know what i would find
when i went looking for a reason,
i know i didn't read between the lines
and, baby, i've got nowhere to go

i tried to take the road less traveled by
but nothing seems to work the first few times
am i right?

so how can i ever try to be better?
nobody ever lets me in
i can still see you.
this ain't the best view
on the outside looking in
and i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outside

you saw me there, but never knew
that i would give it all up to be
a part of this, a part of you.
and now it's all too late. so you see...

you could've helped if you had wanted to
but no one notices until it's too late to do anything

so how can i ever try to be better?
nobody ever lets me in
i can still see you.
this ain't the best view
on the outside looking in
and i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outside

oh, yeah

so how can i ever try to be better?
nobody ever lets me in
and i can still see you.
this ain't the best view
on the outside looking in
and i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outside
"
6,tied together with a smile,"

seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
is the face in the mirror looking back at you
you walk around here thinking you're not pretty
but that's not true 'cause i know you

hold on, baby, you're losing it
the water's high, you're jumping into it
and letting go
and no one knows
that you cry, but you don't tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and you're tied together with a smile
but you're coming undone

i guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
hoping it will end up in his pocket
but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain

oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
it's not his price to pay

hold on, baby, you're losing it
the water's high, you're jumping into it
and letting go
and no one knows
that you cry, but you don't tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and you're tied together with a smile
but you're coming undone

hold on, baby, you're losing it
the water's high, you're jumping into it
and letting go
and no one knows
that you cry, but you don't tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and you're tied together with a smile
but you're coming undone

you're tied together with a smile
but you're coming undone
goodbye, baby
with a smile, baby, baby
"
7,stay beautiful,"

cory's eyes are like a jungle
he smiles, it's like the radio
he whispers songs into my window
in words that nobody knows
there's pretty girls on every corner
that watch him as he's walking home
saying, ""does he know?""
will you ever know?

[chorus:]
you're beautiful
every little piece love
and don't you know
you're really gonna be someone
ask anyone
and when you find everything you looked for
i hope your life leads you back to my door
oh, but if it don't
stay beautiful

cory finds another way to be
the highlight of my day
i'm taking pictures in my mind
so i can save them for a rainy day
it's hard to make a conversation
when he's taking my breath away
i should say, hey, by the way

[chorus]

if you and i are a story
that never gets told
if what you are is a daydream
i'll never get to hold
at least you'll know

you're beautiful
every little piece love
and don't you know
you're really gonna be someone
ask anyone
and when you find everything you looked for
i hope your life leads you back to my front door
oh, but if it don't
will you stay
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
la la la
oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, but if it don't
stay beautiful
stay beautiful
na, na, na, na, na
"
8,should've said no,"

it's strange to think the songs we used to sing
the smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
yesterday i found out about you
even now just looking at you feels wrong

you say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
it was a moment of weakness and you said, ""yes.""

you should've said ""no"", you should've gone home
you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
you should've known that word
'bout what you did with her'd
get back to me (get back to me).
and i should've been there in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself, ""why?""
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
you should've said ""no"", baby, and you might still have me

you can see that i've been crying
and baby, you know all the right things to say
but do you honestly expect me to believe
we could ever be the same?

you say that the past is the past, you need one chance
it was a moment of weakness and you said, ""yes.""

you should've said ""no"", you should've gone home
you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
you should've known that word
'bout what you did with her'd,
get back to me (get back to me).
and i should've been there in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself, ""why?""
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
you should've said ""no"", baby, and you might still have me

i can't resist
before you go, tell me this:
was it worth it?
was she worth this?

no... no, no, no...

you should've said ""no"", you should've gone home
you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
you should've known that word
'bout what you did with her'd,
get back to me (get back to me).
and i should've been there in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself, ""why?""
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
you should've said ""no"", baby, and you might still have me
"
9,mary's song (oh my my my),"

she said, i was seven and you were nine
i looked at you like the stars that shined
in the sky, the pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
and rolled their eyes and said oh my my my

take me back to the house in the backyard tree
said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
you never did, you never did
take me back when our world was one block wide
i dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
just two kids, you and i...
oh my my my my

well, i was sixteen when suddenly
i wasn't that little girl you used to see
but your eyes still shined like pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
they never believed we'd really fall in love
and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
and said oh my my my...

take me back to the creek beds we turned up
two a.m. riding in your truck and all i need is you next to me
take me back to the time we had our very first fight
the slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
you stayed outside till the morning light
oh my my my my

a few years had gone and come around
we were sitting at our favorite spot in town
and you looked at me, got down on one knee

take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
our whole town came and our mamas cried
you said i do and i did too
take me home where we met so many years before
we'll rock our babies on that very front porch
after all this time, you and i

i'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
i'll still look at you like the stars that shine
in the sky, oh my my my...
"
10,our song,"

i was riding shotgun
with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
he's got a one-hand feel
on the steering wheel
the other on my heart
i look around, turn the radio down
he says, ""baby is something wrong?""
i say, ""nothing.
i was just thinking
how we don't have a song.""
and he says...

[chorus:]
our song is the slamming screen door,
sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
when we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date: ""man, i didn't kiss her, when i should have.""
and when i got home ... 'fore i said, ""amen.""
asking god if he could play it again

i was walking up
the front porch steps
after everything that day
had gone all wrong
and been trampled on
and lost and thrown away
got to the hallway,
well, on my way
to my lovin' bed
i almost didn't notice
all the roses
and the note that said,..

[chorus:]
our song is the slamming screen door,
sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
when we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date: ""man, i didn't kiss her, when i should have.""
and when i got home ... 'fore i said, ""amen.""
asking god if he could play it again

i've heard every album, listened to the radio
waited for something to come along
that was as good as our song...

[chorus:]
'cause our song is the slamming screen door,
sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
when we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'cause it's late and his mama don't know
our song is the way he laughs
the first date: ""man, i didn't kiss him, when i should have.""
and when i got home ... 'fore i said, ""amen.""
asking god if he could play it again
play it again

oh, yeah...
oh-oh, yeah.

i was riding shotgun
with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
i grabbed a pen
and an old napkin
and i wrote down our song
"
11,i'm only me when i'm with you,"

friday night beneath the stars
in a field behind your yard.
you and i are paintin' pictures in the sky.
and sometimes we don't say a thing;
just listen to the crickets sing.
everything i need is right here by my side.

and i know everything about you
i don't wanna live without you.

i'm only up when you're not down.
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
it's like no matter what i do.
well, you drive me crazy half the time;
the other half i'm only tryna let you know that what i feel is true.
and i'm only me when i'm with you.

just a small town boy and girl
livin' in a crazy world.
tryna figure out what is and isn't true.
and i don't try to hide my tears,
the secrets or my deepest fears.
through it all nobody gets me like you do.

and you know everything about me.
you say that you can't live without me.

i'm only up when you're not down.
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
it's like no matter what i do.
well, you drive me crazy half the time;
the other half i'm only tryna let you know that what i feel is true.
and i'm only me when i'm with you.

when i'm with anybody else
it's so hard to be myself.
and only you can tell...

...that i'm only up when you're not down.
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
it's like no matter what i do.
well, you drive me crazy half the time;
the other half i'm only tryna let you know that what i feel is true.
and i'm only me
who i wanna be.
well, i'm only me when i'm with you,
with you.
"
12,invisible,"

she can't see the way your eyes
light up when you smile.
she'll never notice how you stop and stare
whenever she walks by.

and you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her,
but you are everything to me.

and i just wanna show you
she don't even know you,
she's never gonna love you like i want to.
and you just see right through me,
but if you only knew me,
we could be a beautiful
miracle,
unbelievable
instead of just invisible.

there's a fire inside of you
that can't help but shine through.
she's never gonna see the light,
no matter what you do.

and all i think about is how to make you think of me,
and everything that we could be.

i just wanna show you
she don't even know you,
she's never gonna love you like i want to.
and you just see right through me,
but if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful
miracle,
unbelievable
instead of just invisible.

like shadows in a faded light.
oh, we're invisible.
i just wanna open your eyes,
and make you realize.

i just wanna show you
she don't even know you.
baby, let me love you,
let me want you.
you just see right through me,
but if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful
miracle,
unbelievable
instead of just invisible.

she can't see the way your eyes
light up when you smile.
"
13,a perfectly good heart,"

[chorus 1:]
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?
why would you wanna make the very first scar?
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

maybe i should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall.
and realized by the distance in your eyes that i would be the one to fall.
no matter what you say, i still can't believe
that you would walk away.
it don't make sense to me, but:

[repeat chorus 1:]
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
why would you wanna make the very first scar?
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

it's not unbroken anymore.
how do i get it back the way it was before?

[chorus 2:]
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?
why would you wanna make the very first scar?
why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:

[repeat chorus 1:]
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
why would you wanna make the very first scar?
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
"
14,last christmas,"

last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year,
to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special

once bitten and twice shy
i keep my distance but you still catch my eye
tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

merry christmas, i wrapped it up and sent it
with a note saying 'i love you'. i meant it
now i know what a fool i've been
but if you kissed me now, i know you'd fool me again

last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year,
to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special

last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year,
to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special

a crowded room and friends with tired eyes
i'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
my god, i thought you were someone to rely on
me? i guess i was a shoulder to cry on

a face on a lover with a fire in his heart
a girl on a cover but you tore her apart
maybe this year
maybe this year i'll give it to someone special

'cause last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year,
to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special

last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year,
to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special

and last christmas
and this year
it won't be anything like, anything like

last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year,
to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special
"
15,christmases when you were mine,"

please take down the misletoe
cause i don't wanna think about that right now
cause everything i want is miles away
in a snow covered little town
my momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
season's greetings, hope you're well
well i'm doing alright
if you were wondering
lately i can never tell

i know this shouldn't be a lonely time
but there were christmases when you were mine

i've been doing fine without you, really
up until the nights got cold
and everybody's here, except you, baby
seems like everyone's got someone to hold

but for me it's just a lonely time
cause there were christmases when you were mine

merry christmas everybody
that'll have to be something i just say this year
i'll bet you got your mom another sweater
and were your cousins late again
when you were putting up the lights this year
did you notice one less pair of hands

i know this shouldn't be a lonely time
but there were christmases when i didn't wonder how you are tonight
cause there were christmases when you were mine

you were mine
"
16,santa baby,"

santa baby, slip a sable under the tree for me
i've been an awful good girl, santa baby
so hurry down the chimney tonight

santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
well, i'll wait up for you, dear, santa baby
so hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah

think of all the fun i've missed
think of all the boys i haven't kissed
next year i could be just as good
if you check off my christmas list

santa baby, i want a yacht and really that's not a lot
i've been an angel all year, santa baby
so hurry down the chimney tonight

santa, honey, there's one more thing i really do need,
the deed
to a platinum mine, santa honey
so hurry down the chimney tonight

come and trim my christmas tree
with some decorations bought at tiffany's
i really do believe in you
let's see if you believe in me

santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
a ring
and i don't mean on the phone, santa baby
so hurry down the chimney tonight
"
17,silent night,"

silent night, holy night
all is calm and all is bright
round yon virgin mother and child
holy infant so tender and mild
sleep in heavenly peace
sleep in heavenly peace

silent night, holy night
shepherds quake at the sight
glories stream from heaven afar
heavenly hosts sing hallelujah
christ the savior is born
christ our savior is born

silent night, holy night
son of god
love's pure light
radiant beams from thy holy face
with the dawn of redeeming grace
jesus lord at thy birth
jesus lord at thy birth

hallelujah!
hallelujah!
hallelujah!

christ the savior is born
"
18,christmas must be something more,"

what if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?
would the song still survive without five golden rings?
would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?
what would happen if god never let it snow?
what would happen if christmas carols told a lie?
tell me what would you find

you'd see that today holds something special
something holy, not superficial
so here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
it's something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
so here's something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something more

what if angels did not pay attention to
all the things that we wished they would always do?
what if happiness came in a cardboard box?
then i think there is something we all forgot
what would happen if presents all went away?
tell me what would you find

you'd see that today holds something special
something holy, not superficial
so here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
it's something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
so here's something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something more

we get so caught up in all of it
business and relationships
hundred mile an hour lives
and it's this time of year
and everybody's here
it seems the last thing on your mind

is that the day holds something special
something holy, not superficial?
so here's to jesus christ who saved our lives
it's something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
but here's something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something
christmas must be something
christmas must be something more

there's gotta be more
there's gotta be more
"
19,white christmas,"

i'm dreaming of a white christmas
just like the ones i used to know
where the tree tops glisten and children listen
to hear sleigh bells in the snow

i'm dreaming of a white christmas
with every christmas card i write
may your days be merry and bright
and may all your christmases be white

i'm dreaming of a white christmas
just like the ones i used to know
so may your days be merry and bright
and may all your christmases be white

may your days be merry and bright
and may all your christmases be white

20,jump then fall,"

21,untouchable,"

untouchable like a distant diamond sky,
i'm reaching out and i just can't tell you why
i'm caught up in you,
i'm caught up in you

untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
and when you're close i feel like coming undone

in the middle of the night
when i'm in this dream
it's like a million little stars
spelling out your name
you gotta come on, come on
say that we'll be together
come on, come on
little taste of heaven

it's half full, and i won't wait here all day
i know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

but you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
and now that you're close i feel like coming undone

in the middle of the night
when i'm in this dream
it's like a million little stars
spelling out your name
you gotta come on, come on
say that we'll be together
come on, come on

oh, in the middle of the night
waking from this dream
i wanna feel you by my side
standing next to me
you gotta come on, come on
say that we'll be together
come on, come on
little taste of heaven

i'm caught up in you. oh, oh.

but you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
now that you're close i feel like coming undone

in the middle of the night
when i'm in this dream
it's like a million little stars
spelling out your name
you gotta come on, come on

"
22,forever & always (piano version),"

once upon a time
i believe it was a tuesday when i caught your eye
and we caught onto something
i hold onto the night
you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
were you just kidding cause it seems to me
this thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
i don't feel welcome anymore
baby, what happened, please tell me
cause one second it was perfect
now you're half way out the door

and i stare at the phone
he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to
when he said forever and always
oh, and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here
and it rains when you're gone
i was there when you said forever and always

was i out of line?
did i say something way too honest?
made you run and hide like a scared little boy
i looked into your eyes
thought i knew you for a minute now i'm not so sure
so here's to everything coming down to nothing
here's to silence that cuts me to the core
where is this going?
thought i knew for a minute but i don't anymore

and i stare at the phone
he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to
when he said forever and always
and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here
and it rains when you're gone
i was there when you said forever and always

you didn't mean it baby
i don't think so, oh oh oh
back up, baby back up
did you forget everything?
back up, baby back up
did you forget everything?

back up, baby back up
please back up, oh back up
back up, baby back up

cause it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here
and it rains when you're gone
i was there when you said forever and always

and i stare at the phone
he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to
when we said forever and always
cause it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here
and it rains when you're gone
i was there when you said forever and always

you didn't mean it baby
you said forever and always, yeah
"
23,come in with the rain,"

i could go back to every laugh
but i don't wanna' go there anymore
and i know all the steps up to your door
but i don't wanna' go there anymore

talk to the wind, talk to the sky
talk to the man with the reasons why
and let me know what you find

i'll leave my window open
'cause i'm too tired at night to call your name
just know i'm right here hopin'
that you'll come in with the rain

i could stand up and sing you a song
but i don't wanna' have to go that far
and i, i've got you down
i know you by heart
and you don't even know where i start

talk to yourself, talk to the tears
talk to the man who put you here
and don't wait for the sky to clear

i'll leave my window open
'cause i'm too tired at night to call your name
oh, just know i'm right here hopin'
that you'll come in with the rain

i've watched you so long
screamed your name
i don't know what else i can say

but i'll leave my window open
'cause i'm too tired at night for all these games
just know i'm right here hopin'
that you'll come in with the rain

i could go back to every laugh
but i don't wanna' go there anymore…
"
24,superstar,"

this is wrong but i can't help but feel like
there ain't nothing more right babe
misty morning comes again and i can't
help but wish i could see your face
and i knew from the first note played
i'd be breaking all my rules to see you
you smile that beautiful smile and
all the girls in the front row scream your name

so dim that spotlight, tell me things like
i can't take my eyes off of you
i'm no one special, just another
wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

morning loneliness, comes around when i'm not
dreaming about you
when my world wakes up today
you'll be in another town
and i knew when i saw your face, i'd be
counting down the ways to see you
you smile that beautiful smile and
all the girls in the front row scream your name

so dim that spotlight, tell me things like
i can't take my eyes off of you
i'm no one special, just another
wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

you played in bars, you play guitar
i'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
and you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
every night from the radio

so dim that spotlight, tell me things like
i can't take my eyes off of you
i'm no one special, just another
wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
sweet, sweet superstar, superstar
"
25,the other side of the door,"

in the heat of the fight i walked away
ignoring words that you were saying
trying to make me stay
i said, ""this time i've had enough.""
and you've called a hundred times
but i'm not picking up

'cause i'm so mad i might tell you that it's over
but if you look a little closer

i said, ""leave,"" but all i really want is you
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming, ""i'm in love with you.""
wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
and don't you leave 'cause i know
all i need is on the other side of the door

me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
going through the photographs, staring at the phone
i keep going back over things we both said
and i remember the slamming door and all the things that i misread

so babe if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't see
when i left i wanted you to chase after me

yeah, i said, ""leave,"" but all i really want is you
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming, ""i'm in love with you.""
wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
and don't you leave 'cause i know
all i need is on the other side of the door

and i'll scream out the window
i can't even look at you
i don't need you but i do, i do, i do
i say, ""there's nothing you can say to make this right again.
i mean it, i mean it.""
what i mean is...

i said, ""leave,"" but baby all i want is you
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming, ""i'm in love with you.""
wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
and don't you leave 'cause i know
all i need is on the other side of the door

with your face and the beautiful eyes
and the conversation with the little white lies
and the faded picture of a beautiful night
you carry me from your car up the stairs
and i broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
after everything and that little black dress
after everything i must confess, i need you
"
26,fearless,"

there's somethin' 'bout the way
the street looks when it's just rained
there's a glow off the pavement
you walk me to the car
and you know i wanna ask you to dance right there
in the middle of the parking lot
yeah
oh yeah

we're drivin' down the road
i wonder if you know
i'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
but you're just so cool
run your hands through your hair
absent-mindedly makin' me want you

and i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance in a storm in my best dress
fearless

so, baby, drive slow
'til we run out of road in this one horse town
i wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
you put your eyes on me
in this moment now capture it, remember it

'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance in a storm in my best dress
fearless

well, you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake
i'm not usually this way
but you pull me in and i'm a little more brave
it's the first kiss,
it's flawless,
really something,
it's fearless.

oh yeah

'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance in a storm in my best dress
fearless

'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance in a storm in my best dress
fearless

oh-oh
oh yeah
"
27,fifteen,"

you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
it's the morning of your very first day
you say ""hi"" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
try and stay out of everybody's way
it's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
for the next four years in this town
hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,
""you know i haven't seen you around before.""

'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen
feeling like there's nothing to figure out
well, count to ten, take it in
this is life before you know who you're gonna be
fifteen

you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail
and soon enough you're best friends
laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
we'll be out of here as soon as we can
and then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
and you're feeling like flying
and your mamma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
and you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
when the night ends

'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
when you're fifteen
and your first kiss makes your head spin round
but in your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team
but i didn't know it at fifteen

when all you wanted was to be wanted
wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

back then i swore i was gonna marry him someday
but i realized some bigger dreams of mine
and abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind
and we both cried

'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen
don't forget to look before you fall
i've found time can heal most anything
and you just might find who you're supposed to be
i didn't know who i was supposed to be at fifteen

la, la, la, la, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la, la, la

your very first day
take a deep breath, girl
take a deep breath as you walk through the doors.
"
28,love story,"

we were both young when i first saw you.
i close my eyes and the flashback starts:
i'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.

see the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
see you make your way through the crowd
and say, ""hello.""
little did i know...

that you were romeo, you were throwing pebbles,
and my daddy said, ""stay away from juliet.""
and i was crying on the staircase
begging you, ""please don't go.""
and i said...

romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
i'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess,
it's a love story, baby, just say ""yes"".

so i sneak out to the garden to see you.
we keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
so close your eyes,
escape this town for a little while.
oh, oh.

'cause you were romeo, i was a scarlet letter,
and my daddy said, ""stay away from juliet.""
but you were everything to me,
i was begging you, ""please don't go.""
and i said...

romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
i'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess.
it's a love story, baby, just say ""yes"".

romeo, save me. they're trying to tell me how to feel.
this love is difficult but it's real.
don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
it's a love story, baby, just say ""yes"".

oh, oh, oh.

i got tired of waiting
wondering if you were ever coming around.
my faith in you was fading
when i met you on the outskirts of town.
and i said...

romeo, save me. i've been feeling so alone.
i keep waiting for you, but you never come.
is this in my head? i don't know what to think.
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

marry me, juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
i love you, and that's all i really know.
i talked to your dad – go pick out a white dress
it's a love story, baby, just say ""yes"".

oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

'cause we were both young when i first saw you
"
29,hey stephen,"

hey, stephen,
i know looks can be deceiving,
but i know i saw a light in you.
and as we walked
we were talking.
i didn't say half the things i wanted to.

of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
i'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold.
hey, stephen,
boy, you might have me believing
i don't always have to be alone.

'cause i can't help it if you look like an angel,
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain.
so, come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you.
can't help it if there's no one else.
i can't help myself.

hey, stephen,
i've been holding back this feeling.
so, i got some things to say to you, ha.
i seen it all—
so i thought—
but i never seen nobody shine the way you do.

the way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name—
it's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change.
hey, stephen,
why are people always leaving?
i think you and i should stay the same.

'cause i can't help it if you look like an angel,
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain.
so, come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you.
can't help it if there's no one else.
i can't help myself.

they're dimming the street lights.
you're perfect for me. why aren't you here tonight?
i'm waiting alone now, so, come on and come out
and pull me near and shine, shine, shine.

hey, stephen,
i could give you fifty reasons
why i should be the one you choose.
all those other girls—
well, they're beautiful,
but would they write a song for you?

i can't help it if you look like an angel,
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain.
so, come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you.
can't help it if there's no one else.
i can't help myself...

...if you look like an angel.
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain.
so, come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you.
can't help it if there's no one else.
i can't help myself.

myself.
can't help myself.
i can't help myself.
"
30,white horse,"

say you're sorry
that face of an angel
comes out just when you need it to
as i paced back and forth all this time
'cause i honestly believed in you
holding on
the days drag on
stupid girl,
i should have known, i should have known

[chorus:]
that i'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
lead her up the stairwell
this ain't hollywood, this is a small town,
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down,
now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

maybe i was naïve,
got lost in your eyes
and never really had a chance
my mistake, i didn't know to be in love
you had to fight to have the upper hand
i had so many dreams
about you and me
happy endings
now i know

[chorus:]
that i'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
lead her up the stairwell
this ain't hollywood, this is a small town,
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down,
now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

and there you are on your knees,
begging for forgiveness, begging for me
just like i always wanted but i'm so sorry

'cause i'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale,
i'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
this is a big world, that was a small town
there in my rear view mirror disappearing now
and it's too late for you and your white horse
now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now

oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
try and catch me now
oh, it's too late
to catch me now
"
31,you belong with me,"

you're on the phone with your girlfriend
she's upset, she's going off about something that you said
'cause she doesn't get your humor like i do.

i'm in the room, it's a typical tuesday night.
i'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
and she'll never know your story like i do.

but she wears short skirts
i wear t-shirts
she's cheer captain
and i'm on the bleachers
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

if you could see
that i'm the one
who understands you.
been here all along.
so, why can't you see
you belong with me,
you belong with me.

walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
i can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,
""hey, isn't this easy?""

and you've got a smile
that could light up this whole town.
i haven't seen it in a while
since she brought you down.

you say you're fine i know you better than that.
hey, what you doing with a girl like that?

she wears high heels,
i wear sneakers.
she's cheer captain,
and i'm on the bleachers.
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

if you could see
that i'm the one
who understands you,
been here all along.
so, why can't you see
you belong with me.

standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
all this time how could you not know, baby?
you belong with me,
you belong with me.

[instrumental]

oh, i remember you driving to my house
in the middle of the night.
i'm the one who makes you laugh
when you know you're 'bout to cry.
i know your favorite songs,
and you tell me about your dreams.
think i know where you belong,
think i know it's with me.

can't you see
that i'm the one
who understands you?
been here all along.
so, why can't you see
you belong with me.

standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
all this time how could you not know, baby?
you belong with me,
you belong with me.

you belong with me.

have you ever thought just maybe
you belong with me?
you belong with me.
"
32,breathe,"

i see your face in my mind as i drive away
'cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.
people are people, and sometimes we change our minds.
but it's killing me to see you go after all this time.

music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie.
it's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see.
'cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down.
now i don't know what to be without you around.

and we know it's never simple, never easy,
never a clean break. no one here to save me.
you're the only thing i know like the back of my hand.

and i can't breathe without you
but i have to.
breathe without you
but i have to.

never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt.
every little bump in the road i tried to swerve.
people are people, and sometimes it doesn't work out.
nothing we say is gonna save us from the fallout.

and we know it's never simple, never easy,
never a clean break. no one here to save me.
you're the only thing i know like the back of my hand.

and i can't breathe without you
but i have to.
breathe without you
but i have to.

it's two am.
feelin' like i just lost a friend.
hope you know it's not easy, easy for me.
it's two am.
feelin' like i just lost a friend.
hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me.

and we know it's never simple, never easy,
never a clean break. no one here to save me.

i can't breathe without you
but i have to.
breathe without you
but i have to.

breathe without you
but i have to.

i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry
"
33,tell me why,"

i took a chance, i took a shot
and you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not
you took a swing, i took it hard
and down here from the ground i see who you are

i'm sick and tired of your attitude
i'm feeling like i don't know you
you tell me that you love me then you cut me down
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
makes me run for cover when you're around
and here's to you and your temper
yes, i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doing to me
tell me why

you could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
well i get so confused and frustrated
forget what i'm trying to say, oh

i'm sick and tired of your reasons
i got no one to believe in
you tell me that you want me, then push me around
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
makes me run for cover when you're around
here's to you and your temper
yes, i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doing to me
tell me why…

why…do you have to make me feel small
so you can feel whole inside
why…do you have to put down my dreams
so you're the only thing on my mind

i'm sick and tired of your attitude
i'm feeling like i don't know you
you tell me that you want me then cut me down
i'm sick and tired of your reasons
i've got no one to believe in
you ask me for my love then you push me around
here's to you and your temper
yes, i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doing to me
tell me why
why, tell me why

i take a step back, let you go
i told you i'm not bulletproof
now you know
"
34,you're not sorry,"

all this time i was wasting
hoping you would come around
i've been giving out chances every time
and all you do is let me down
and it's taken me this long
baby but i figured you out
and you're thinking we'll be fine again
but not this time around

you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last straw
don't wanna hurt anymore
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you baby
like i did before
you're not sorry... no, no, no, no

you are looking so innocent
i might believe you if i didn't know
could've loved you all my life
if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
and you got your share of secrets
and i'm tired of being last to know
and now you're asking me to listen
cause it's worked each time before

but you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last straw
don't wanna hurt anymore
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you baby
like i did before
you're not sorry... no, no, no

you're not sorry... no, no, no

you had me crawling for you honey
and it never would've gone away, no
you used to shine so bright
but i watched all of it fade

so you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last straw
there's nothing left to beg for
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you baby
like i did before
you're not sorry... no, no, no

you're not sorry... no, no, no
no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no
"
35,the way i loved you,"

he is sensible and so incredible 
and all my single friends are jealous 
he says everything i need to hear and it's like 
i couldn't ask for anything better 
he opens up my door and i get into his car 
and he says you look beautiful tonight 
and i feel perfectly fine 

but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
and it's 2am and i'm cursing your name 
you're so in love that you act insane 
and that's the way i loved you 
breakin' down and coming undone 
it's a roller coaster kinda rush 
and i never knew i could feel that much 
and that's the way i loved you 

he respects my space 
and never makes me wait 
and he calls exactly when he says he will 
he's close to my mother 
talks business with my father 
he's charming and endearing 
and i'm comfortable 

but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
and it's 2am and i'm cursing your name 
you're so in love that you act insane 
and that's the way i loved you 
breakin' down and coming undone 
it's a roller coaster kinda rush 
and i never knew i could feel that much 
and that's the way i loved you 

he can't see the smile i'm faking 
and my heart's not breaking 
cause i'm not feeling anything at all 
and you were wild and crazy 
just so frustrating intoxicating 
complicated, got away by some mistake and now 

i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
it's 2am and i'm cursing your name 
i'm so in love that i acted insane 
and that's the way i loved you 
breaking down and coming undone 
it's a roller coaster kinda rush 
and i never knew i could feel that much 
and that's the way i loved you oh, oh 

and that's the way i loved you oh, oh 
never knew i could feel that much 
and that's the way i loved you
"
36,forever & always,"

once upon a time,
i believe it was a tuesday when i caught your eye
and we caught onto something
i hold onto the night,
you looked me in the eye
and told me you loved me

were you just kidding?
'cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
we almost never speak
i don't feel welcome anymore
baby, what happened, please tell me?
'cause one second it was perfect, now you're half way out the door

and i stare at the phone,
he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said forever and always
oh, and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always

was i out of line?
did i say something way too honest?
made you run and hide
like a scared little boy?
i looked into your eyes
thought i knew you for a minute, now i'm not so sure

so here's to everything
coming down to nothing
here's to silence
that cuts me to the core
where is this going?
thought i knew for a minute, but i don't anymore

and i stare at the phone,
he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low, you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said forever and always
oh, and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always

you didn't mean it, baby,
i don't think so

back up, baby, back up
did you forget everything?
back up, baby, back up
did you forget everything?

'cause it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always

oh, i stare at the phone,
he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when we said forever and always

and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always

you didn't mean it, baby,
you said forever and always... yeah
"
37,the best day,"

i'm five years old
it's getting cold
i've got my big coat on

i hear your laugh
and look up smiling at you
i run and run

past the pumpkin patch
and the tractor rides
look now -- the sky is gold

i hug your legs
and fall asleep
on the way home

i don't know why all the trees change in the fall
i know you're not scared of anything at all
don't know if snow white's house is near or far away
but i know i had the best day
with you today

i'm thirteen now
and don't know how
my friends could be so mean

i come home crying
and you hold me tight
and grab the keys

and we drive and drive
until we've found a town
far enough away

and we talk
and window-shop
'til i've forgotten all their names

i don't know who i'm gonna talk to now at school
i know i'm laughing on the car ride home with you
don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
but i know i had the best day
with you today

i have an excellent father
his strength is making me stronger
god smiles on my little brother
inside and out he's better than i am

i grew up in a pretty house
and i had space to run
and i had the best days with you

there is a video i found from back when i was three
you set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me

it's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
and daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

and now i know why all the trees change in the fall
i know you were on my side even when i was wrong

and i love you for giving me your eyes
for staying back and watching me shine

and i didn't know if you knew
so i'm taking this chance to say
that i had the best day
with you today
"
38,change,"

and it’s a sad picture,
the final blow hits you
somebody else gets what you wanted again
and you know it’s all the same,
another time and place
repeating history and you’re getting sick of it

but i believe in whatever you do
and i’ll do anything to see it through

because these things will change
can you feel it now?
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution, the time will come
for us to finally win
and we’ll sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah

so we’ve been outnumbered
raided and now cornered
it’s hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
we’re getting stronger now
find things they never found
they might be bigger
but we’re faster and never scared

you can walk away, say we don’t need this
but there’s something in your eyes says we can beat this

'cause these things will change
can you feel it now?
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution, the time will come
for us to finally win
and we’ll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah

tonight we'll stand, get off our knees
fight for what we’ve worked for all these years
and the battle was long, it’s the fight of our lives
but we’ll stand up champions tonight

it was the night things changed
can you see it now?
these walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
this revolution, throw your hands up
'cause we never gave in
and we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
hallelujah
"
39,mine,"

you were in college working part time waiting tables,
left a small town, never looked back.
i was a flight risk with a fear of fallin'
wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts.

i say, ""can you believe it?""
as we're lying on the couch
the moment i can see it.
yes, yes, i can see it now.

do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
you put your arm around me for the first time.
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter.
you are the best thing that's ever been mine.

flash forward and we're taking on the world together,
and there's a drawer of my things at your place.
you learn my secrets and you figure out why i'm guarded,
you say we'll never make my parents' mistakes.

but we got bills to pay,
we got nothing figured out,
when it was hard to take,
yes, yes, this is what i thought about.

do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
you put your arm around me for the first time.
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter.
you are the best thing that's ever been mine.

do you remember all the city lights on the water?
you saw me start to believe for the first time.
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter.
you are the best thing that's ever been mine.

and i remember that fight,
two-thirty am,
as everything was slipping right out of our hands.
i ran out crying and you followed me out into the street.
braced myself for the ""goodbye""
'cause that's all i've ever known.
then you took me by surprise.
you said, ""i'll never leave you alone.""

you said, ""i remember how we felt sitting by the water.
and every time i look at you, it's like the first time.
i fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter.
she is the best thing that's ever been mine.""

hold on, make it last.
hold on, never turn back.

(hold on)
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
(hold on)
you are the best thing that's ever been mine.

(hold on)
do you believe it?
(hold on)
we're gonna make it now.
(hold on)
and i can see it,
(yes, yes)
i can see it now (see it now, see it now)
"
40,sparks fly,"

the way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
and i'm a house of cards
you're the kind of reckless
that should send me runnin'
but i kinda know that i won't get far
and you stood there in front of me
just close enough to touch
close enough to hope you couldn't see
what i was thinking of

drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile

my mind forgets to remind me
you're a bad idea
you touch me once and it's really something,
you find i'm even better than you imagined i would be.
i'm on my guard for the rest of the world
but with you i know it's no good
and i could wait patiently but i really wish you would...

drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile

i'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild.
just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right.
and lead me up the staircase
won't you whisper soft and slow?
i'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show.

drop everything now,
meet me in the pouring rain,
kiss me on the sidewalk,
take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile.
get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile

and the sparks fly...
oh, baby, smile...
and the sparks fly...
"
41,back to december,"

i'm so glad you made time to see me.
how's life? tell me how's your family?
i haven't seen them in a while.

you've been good, busier than ever.
we small-talk, work and the weather.
your guard is up and i know why.

because the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind.
you gave me roses and i left them there to die.

so this is me swallowing my pride,
standing in front of you, saying, ""i'm sorry for that night,""
and i go back to december all the time.

it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine.
i'd go back to december, turn around and make it all right.
i go back to december all the time.

these days i haven't been sleeping,
staying up, playing back myself leavin'.
when your birthday passed and i didn't call.

and i think about summer, all the beautiful times,
i watched you laughing from the passenger side.
and realized i loved you in the fall.

and then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
you gave me all your love and all i gave you was ""goodbye"".

so this is me swallowing my pride,
standing in front of you, saying, ""i'm sorry for that night.""
and i go back to december all the time.

it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine.
i'd go back to december, turn around and change my own mind.
i go back to december all the time.

i miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile.
so good to me, so right.
and how you held me in your arms that september night:
the first time you ever saw me cry.

maybe this is wishful thinking,
probably mindless dreaming,
but if we loved again, i swear i'd love you right.

i'd go back in time and change it but i can't.
so if the chain is on your door i understand.

but this is me swallowing my pride,
standing in front of you, saying, ""i'm sorry for that night.""
and i go back to december.

it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine.
i'd go back to december, turn around and make it all right.
i'd go back to december, turn around and change my own mind

i go back to december all the time.
all the time.
"
42,speak now,"

i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl

i sneak in and see your friends
and her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
and she is yelling at a bridesmaid
somewhere back inside a room
wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

this is surely not what you thought it would be
i lose myself in a daydream
where i stand and say

[chorus:]
don’t say ""yes"", run away now
i’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
don’t wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said, ""speak now.""

fond gestures are exchanged
and the organ starts to play
a song that sounds like a death march
and i am hiding in the curtains
it seems that i was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

she floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
but i know you wish it was me,
you wish it was me,
don’t you?

[chorus:]
don’t say ""yes"", run away now,
i’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door.
don’t wait or say a single vow,
you need to hear me out,
and they said, ""speak now.""
don’t say ""yes"", run away now,
i’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door.
don’t wait or say a single vow,
your time is running out,
and they said, ""speak now.""

oh, la, la
oh, oh
say a single vow

i hear the preacher say, ""speak now or forever hold your peace.""
there’s the silence, there’s my last chance.
i stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me.
horrified looks from everyone in the room
but i’m only looking at you.

i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl

[chorus:]
so, don’t say ""yes"", run away now,
i’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door.
don’t wait or say a single vow,
you need to hear me out,
and they said, ""speak now.""
and you say, ""let’s run away now,
i’ll meet you when i’m out of my tux at the back door.
baby, i didn’t say my vows,
so glad you were around
when they said, ""speak now.""
"
43,dear john,"

long were the nights
when my days once revolved around you
counting my footsteps
praying the floor won't fall through
again

and my mother accused me of losing my mind
but i swore i was fine

you paint me a blue sky
and go back and turn it to rain
and i lived in your chess game
but you changed the rules every day

wonderin' which version of you i might get on the phone tonight.
well, i stopped pickin' up, and this song is to let you know why.

dear john,
i see it all now that you're gone.
don't you think i was too young to be messed
with?
the girl in the dress
cried the whole way home.
i should've known.

well, maybe it's me
and my blind optimism
to blame.
or maybe it's you and your sick need
to give love then take it away.

and you'll add my name
to your long list of traitors
who don't understand.
and i look back in regret.
how i ignored when they said,
""run as fast as you can.""

dear john,
i see it all now that you're gone.
don't you think i was too young to be messed
with?
the girl in the dress
cried the whole way home.

dear john,
i see it all now. it was wrong.
don't you think nineteen's too young to be played
by your dark twisted games?
when i loved you so.
i should've known.

you are an expert at ""sorry""
and keeping lines blurry.
never impressed by me acing your tests.
all the girls that you've run dry
have tired lifeless eyes
'cause you've burned them out.

but i took your matches
before fire could catch me.
so, don't look now.
i'm shining like fireworks
over your sad empty town.

dear john,
i see it all now that you're gone.
don't you think i was too young to be messed
with?
the girl in the dress
cried the whole way home.

i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed
with?
the girl in the dress
wrote you a song.
you should've known.

you should've known.
don't you think i was too young?
you should've known.
"
44,mean,"

you, with your words like knives
and swords and weapons that you use against me
you have knocked me off my feet again
got me feeling like a nothing
you, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
calling me out when i'm wounded
you, picking on the weaker man

well you can take me down with just one single blow
but you don't know, what you don't know...

someday i'll be living in a big old city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?

you, with your switching sides
and your wildfire lies and your humiliation
you have pointed out my flaws again
as if i don't already see them
i walk with my head down
trying to block you out 'cause i'll never impress you
i just wanna feel okay again

i bet you got pushed around
somebody made you cold
but the cycle ends right now
'cause you can't lead me down that road
and you don't know, what you don't know...

someday i'll be living in a big old city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?

and i can see you years from now in a bar
talking over a football game
with that same big loud opinion
but nobody's listening
washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
drunk and grumbling on about how i can't sing
but all you are is mean

all you are is mean
and a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

but someday i'll be living in a big old city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so?...

someday i'll be living in a big old city (why you gotta be so?...)
and all you're ever gonna be is mean (why you gotta be so?...)
someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me (why you gotta be so?...)
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?
"
45,the story of us,"

i used to think one day we'd tell the story of us,
how we met and the sparks flew instantly,
and people would say, ""they're the lucky ones.""
i used to know my place was the spot next to you.
now i'm searching the room for an empty seat,
'cause lately i don't even know what page you're on.

oh, a simple complication,
miscommunications lead to fall-out.
so many things that i wish you knew.
so many walls up i can't break through.

now i'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking.
and i'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
i don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

next chapter.

how'd we end up this way?
see me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy,
and you're doing your best to avoid me.
i'm starting to think one day i'll tell the story of us,
how i was losing my mind when i saw you here,
but you held your pride like you should've held me.

oh, i'm scared to see the ending,
why are we pretending this is nothing?
i'd tell you i miss you but i don't know how.
i've never heard silence quite this loud.

now i'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking.
and i'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
i don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

this is looking like a contest
of who can act like they care less,
but i liked it better when you were on my side.

the battle's in your hands now,
but i would lay my armour down
if you said you'd rather love than fight.

so many things that you wish i knew,
but the story of us might be ending soon.

now i'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking.
and i'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
but i don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now.

...and we're not speaking.
and i'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
i don't know what to say, since the twist of fate 'cause we're going down,
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

the end.
"
46,never grow up,"

your little hand's wrapped around my finger
and it's so quiet in the world tonight
your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
so i tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
to you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
i'd give all i have, honey
if you could stay like that

oh darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
oh darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
i won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
and no one will desert you
just try to never grow up, never grow up

you're in the car on the way to the movies
and you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
at 14 there's just so much you can't do
and you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
but don't make her drop you off around the block
remember that she's getting older too
and don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

oh darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
oh darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
no one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
and even though you want to, just try to never grow up

take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
remember the footsteps, remember the words said
and all your little brother's favorite songs
i just realized everything i have is someday gonna be gone

so here i am in my new apartment
in a big city, they just dropped me off
it's so much colder than i thought it would be
so i tuck myself in and turn my night light on

wish i'd never grown up
i wish i'd never grown up

oh i don't wanna grow up, wish i'd never grown up
i could still be little
oh i don't wanna grow up, wish i'd never grown up
it could still be simple
oh darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
oh darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
won't let nobody hurt you
won't let no one break your heart
and even though you want to, please try to never grow up
oh, don't you ever grow up
oh, never grow up, just never grow up
"
47,enchanted,"

there i was again tonight
forcing laughter, faking smiles
same old tired lonely place

walls of insincerity,
shifting eyes and vacancy
vanished when i saw your face

all i can say is it was enchanting to meet you

your eyes whispered, ""have we met?""
across the room your silhouette
starts to make its way to me
the playful conversation starts
counter all your quick remarks
like passing notes in secrecy

and it was enchanting to meet you
all i can say is i was enchanted to meet you

this night is sparkling, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you

the lingering question kept me up
2 am, who do you love?
i wonder 'til i'm wide awake
and now i'm pacing back and forth
wishing you were at my door
i'd open up and you would say, ""hey,
it was enchanting to meet you,
all i know is i was enchanted to meet you.""

this night is sparkling, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
this night is flawless, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you

this is me praying that
this was the very first page
not where the story line ends
my thoughts will echo your name
until i see you again
these are the words i held back
as i was leaving too soon
i was enchanted to meet you

please don't be in love with someone else
please don't have somebody waiting on you
please don't be in love with someone else
please don't have somebody waiting on you

this night is sparkling, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
this night is flawless, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you

please don't be in love with someone else
please don't have somebody waiting on you
"
48,better than revenge,"

""now go stand in the corner and think about what you did.""

time for a little revenge

the story starts when it was hot and it was summer and...
i had it all, i had him right there where i wanted him
she came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
she took him faster than you could say ""sabotage""

i never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
i underestimated just who i was dealing with
she had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
she underestimated just who she was stealing from

she's not a saint
and she's not what you think
she's an actress
she's better known
for the things that she does on the mattress

soon she's gonna find
stealing other people's toys
on the playground won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind
she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge

she looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
she looks at me like i'm a trend and she's so over it
i think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
she thinks i'm psycho 'cause i like to rhyme her name with things

but sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
they wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
but no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

she's not a saint
and she's not what you think
she's an actress
she's better known
for the things that she does
on the mattress

soon she's gonna find
stealing other people's toys
on the playground won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind
she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge

i'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
you might have him but haven't you heard
i'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
you might have him but i always get the last word

she's not a saint
and she's not what you think
she's an actress
(she deserve it)
she's better known
for the things that she does on the mattress

soon she's gonna find
stealing other people's toys
on the playground won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind
she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge

do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'cause i don't think you do.
do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
i don't think you do
i don't think you do

let's hear the applause
come on show me how much better you are
(so much better, yeah?)
so you deserve some applause 'cause you're so much better

she took him faster than you could say ""sabotage""
"
49,innocent,"

i guess you really did it this time
left yourself in your warpath
lost your balance on a tightrope
lost your mind tryin' to get it back

wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
always a bigger bed to crawl into
wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
and everybody believed in you?

it's alright, just wait and see
your string of lights is still bright to me
oh, who you are is not where you've been
you're still an innocent
you're still an innocent

did some things you can't speak of
but at night you live it all again
you wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
if only you had seen what you know now then

wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
when everything out of reach
someone bigger brought down to you
wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep
before the monsters caught up to you?

it's alright, just wait and see
your string of lights is still bright to me
oh, who you are is not what you've been
you're still an innocent
it's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
who you are is not what you did
you're still an innocent

time turns flames to embers
you'll have new septembers
every one of us has messed up too
minds change like the weather
i hope you remember
today is never too late to be brand new

it's alright, just wait and see
your string of lights is still bright to me
oh, who you are is not what you've been
you're still an innocent
it's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
who you are is not what you did
you're still an innocent
you're still an innocent

lost your balance on a tightrope
it's never too late to get it back
"
50,haunted,"

you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
but i never thought i'd live to see it break
it's getting dark and it's all too quiet
and i can't trust anything now
and it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

oh, i'm holding my breath
won't lose you again
something's made your eyes go cold

come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
you're all i wanted
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
can't turn back now, i'm haunted

stood there and watched you walk away
from everything we had
but i still mean every word i said to you
he will try to take away my pain
and he just might make me smile
but the whole time i'm wishing he was you instead

oh, i'm holding my breath
won't see you again
something keeps me holding on to nothing

come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
you're all i wanted
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
can't turn back now, i'm haunted

i know, i know, i just know
you're not gone. you can't be gone. no.

come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
won't finish what you started
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
can't go back, i'm haunted

oh

you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
never ever thought i'd see it break.
never thought i'd see it...
"
51,last kiss,"

i still remember the look on your face
lit through the darkness at 1:58
the words that you whispered
for just us to know
you told me you loved me
so why did you go away?
away

i do recall now the smell of the rain
fresh on the pavement
i ran off the plane
that july 9th
the beat of your heart
it jumps through your shirt
i can still feel your arms

but now i'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that i know is
i don't know how to be something you miss
i never thought we'd have a last kiss
never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips

i do remember the swing of your step
the life of the party, you're showing off again
and i roll my eyes and then
you pull me in
i'm not much for dancing
but for you i did

because i love your handshake, meeting my father
i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
how you kissed me when i was in the middle of saying something
there's not a day i don't miss those rude interruptions

and i'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that i know is
i don't know how to be something you miss
never thought we'd have a last kiss
never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips

so i'll watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep
and i feel you forget me like i used to feel you breathe
and i keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
hope it's nice where you are

and i hope the sun shines
and it's a beautiful day
and something reminds you
you wish you had stayed
you can plan for a change in weather and time
but i never planned on you changing your mind

so i'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that i know is
i don't know how to be something you miss
never thought we'd have a last kiss
never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips

just like our last kiss
forever the name on my lips
forever the name on my lips

just like our last...
"
52,long live,"

i said remember this moment
in the back of my mind
the time we stood with our shaking hands
the crowds in stands went wild

we were the kings and the queens
and they read off our names
the night you danced like you knew
our lives would never be the same

you held your head like a hero
on a history book page
it was the end of a decade
but the start of an age

long live the walls we crashed through
how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
i was screaming long live all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
one day, we will be remembered

i said remember this feeling
i pass the pictures around
of all the years that we stood there
on the side-lines wishing for right now

we are the kings and the queens
you traded your baseball cap for a crown
when they gave us our trophies
and we held them up for our town

and the cynics were outraged
screaming, ""this is absurd!""
'cause for a moment a band of thieves
in ripped-up jeans got to rule the world

long live the walls we crashed through
how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
i was screaming long live all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
i'm not afraid

long live all the mountains we moved
i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
i was screaming long live that look on your face
and bring on all the pretenders
one day, we will be remembered

hold on to spinning around
confetti falls to the ground
may these memories break our fall

will you take a moment,
promise me this
that you'll stand by me forever
but if god forbid fate should step in

and force us into a goodbye
if you have children some day
when they point to the pictures
please tell them my name

tell them how the crowds went wild
tell them how i hope they shine

long live the walls we crashed through
i had the time of my life, with you

long, long live the walls we crashed through
how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
and i was screaming long live all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
i'm not afraid

singing, long live all the mountains we moved
i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
and long, long live that look on your face
and bring on all the pretenders
one day, we will be remembered
"
53,ours,"

elevator buttons and morning air
strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
if you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
but right now my time is theirs

seems like there's always someone who disapproves
they'll judge it like they know about me and you
and the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
the jury's out, but my choice is you

so don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ours

you never know what people have up their sleeves
ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
but i don't care 'cause right now you're mine

and you'll say
don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ours

and it's not theirs to speculate
if it's wrong and
your hands are tough
but they are where mine belong and
i'll fight their doubt and give you faith
with this song for you

'cause i love the gap between your teeth
and i love the riddles that you speak
and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
'cause my heart is yours

so don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
but they can't take what's ours
they can't take what's ours

the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ours
"
54,if this was a movie,"

last night i heard my own heart beating
sounded like footsteps on my stairs
six months gone and i'm still reaching
even though i know you're not there
i was playing back a thousand memories, baby
thinking 'bout everything we've been through
maybe i've been going back too much lately
when time stood still and i had you

come back, come back, come back to me like
you would, you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside 'til i came out
come back, come back, come back to me like
you could, you could if you just said you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie you'd be here by now

i know people change and these things happen
but i remember how it was back then
locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
'cause nothing like this ever happened to them,
now i'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
flashback to the night when you said to me,
""nothing's gonna change, not for me and you,
not before i knew how much i had to lose.""

come back, come back, come back to me like
you would, you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside 'til i came out
come back, come back, come back to me like
you could, you could if you just said you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie you'd be here by now

if you're out there,
if you're somewhere,
if you're moving on,
i've been waiting for you.
ever since you've been gone
i just want it back the way it was before.
and i just wanna see you back at my front door.
and i'd say

come back, come back, come back to me like
you would before you said, ""it's not that easy.""
before the fight, before i locked you out
but i take it all back now

come back, come back, come back to me like
you would, you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside 'til i came out
come back, come back, come back to me like
you could, you could if you just said you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie you'd be here by now

you'd be here by now
it's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
baby, what about the ending
oh, i thought you'd be here by now, whoa
thought you'd be here by now
"
55,superman,"

tall, dark and superman
he puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
to save the world or go to work
it's the same thing to me
he's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
i wonder if he knows how much that i miss him
i hang on every word you say

and you smile and say, ""how are you?""
i'll say, ""just fine.""
i always forget to tell you, i love you, i'll love you forever

i watch superman fly away
you've got a busy day today
go save the world, i'll be around
and i watch superman fly away
come back i'll be with you someday
i'll be right here on the ground
when you come back down

tall, dark and beautiful
he's complicated, he's irrational
but i hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
he's not all bad like his reputation
and i can't hear one single word they say

and you'll leave, got places to be
and i'll be ok
i always forget to tell you i love you, i loved you from the very first day

i watch superman fly away
you've got a busy day today
go save the world i'll be around
and i watch superman fly away
come back i'll be with you someday
i'll be right here on the ground
when you come back down

and i watch you fly around the world
and i hope you don't save some other girl
don't forget, don't forget about me
i'm far away but i never let you go
i'm love-struck and looking out the window
don't forget, don't forget where i'll be
right here wishing the flowers were from you
wishing the card was from you
wishing the call was from you

'cause i loved you from the very first day

i watch superman fly away
you've got a busy day today
go save the world, i'll be around
forever and ever here
i watch superman fly away
i swear i'll be with you someday
i'll be right here on the ground
when you come back down

when you come back down
"
56,state of grace,"

i'm walking fast through the traffic lights
busy streets and busy lives
and all we know
is touch and go

we are alone with our changing minds
we fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

and i never (never) saw you coming
and i'll never (never) be the same

you come around and the armor falls
pierce the room like a cannonball
now all we know
is don't let go

we are alone, just you and me
up in your room and our slates are clean
just twin fire signs
four blue eyes

so you were never a saint
and i've loved in shades of wrong
we learn to live with the pain
mosaic broken hearts
but this love is brave and wild

and i never (never) saw you coming
and i'll never (never) be the same

this is a state of grace
this is the worthwhile fight
love is a ruthless game
unless you play it good and right

these are the hands of fate
you're my achilles heel
this is the golden age of something good and right and real

and i never (never) saw you coming
and i'll never (never) be the same

and i never (never) saw you coming
and i'll never
(so you were never a saint
i've loved in shades of wrong)
be the same
(we learn to live with the pain
mosaic broken hearts
but this love is brave and wild)

this is a state of grace
this is the worthwhile fight
love is a ruthless game
unless you play it good and right
"
57,red,"

[verse 1:]
loving him is like driving a new maserati down a dead-end street
faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

[chorus:]
losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark grey all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
but loving him was red
loving him was red

[verse 2:]
touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

[chorus:]
losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark grey all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
but loving him was red
oh, red
burning red

[bridge:]
remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
but moving on from him is impossible
when i still see it all in my head
in burning red
burning, it was red

[chorus:]
oh, losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark grey all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'cause loving him was red
yeah, yeah, red
we're burning red

[post-chorus:]
and that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
comes back to me, burning red
yeah, yeah

his love was like driving a new maserati down a dead-end street
"
58,treacherous,"

put your lips close to mine
as long as they don't touch
out of focus, eye to eye
till the gravity's too much
and i'll do anything you say
if you say it with your hands
and i'd be smart to walk away
but you're quicksand

this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous
and i, i, i like it

i can't decide if it's a choice
getting swept away
i hear the sound of my own voice
asking you to stay
and all we are is skin and bone
trained to get along
forever going with the flow
but you're friction

this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous
i, i, i like it

two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you a—get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should, think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the drive
and i would follow you, follow you home
i'll follow you, follow you home

this hope is treacherous
this daydream is dangerous
this hope is treacherous
i, i, i... i, i, i... i, i, i...

two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you, i'll get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should, think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the drive
and i would follow you, follow you home
i'll follow you, follow you home
i'll follow you, follow you home
i'll follow you, follow you home

this slope is treacherous
i, i, i like it
"
59,i knew you were trouble,"

[music video spoken part:]
i think - i think when it's all over,
it just comes back in flashes, you know?
it's like a kaleidoscope of memories.
it just all comes back. but he never does.
i think part of me knew the second i saw him that this would happen.
it's not really anything he said or anything he did,
it was the feeling that came along with it.
and the crazy thing is i don't know if i'm ever gonna feel that way again.
but i don't know if i should.
i knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright.
but i just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?
maybe he knew that when he saw me.
i guess i just lost my balance.
i think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him.
it was losing me.

once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
i was in your sights, you got me alone
you found me, you found me, you found me
i guess you didn't care, and i guess i liked that
and when i fell hard you took a step back
without me, without me, without me

and he's long gone when he's next to me
and i realize the blame is on me

'cause i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
'til you put me down, oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
now i'm lying on the cold hard ground
oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

no apologies. he'll never see you cry,
pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
you're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
now i heard you moved on from whispers on the street
a new notch in your belt is all i'll ever be
and now i see, now i see, now i see

he was long gone when he met me
and i realize the joke is on me, yeah!

i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
'til you put me down, oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
now i'm lying on the cold hard ground
oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

and the saddest fear comes creeping in
that you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
'til you put me down, oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
now i'm lying on the cold hard ground
oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

i knew you were trouble when you walked in
trouble, trouble, trouble
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
trouble, trouble, trouble

[music video spoken part:]
i don't know if you know who you are until you lose who you are.
"
60,all too well,"

i walked through the door with you, the air was cold
but something 'bout it felt like home somehow
and i left my scarf there at your sister's house
and you've still got it in your drawer even now

oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
we're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
and i can picture it after all these days

and i know it's long gone
and that magic's not here no more
and i might be okay
but i'm not fine at all

'cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
wind in my hair, i was there, i remember it all too well

photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
and your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team
you taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

and i know it's long gone
and there was nothing else i could do
and i forget about you long enough
to forget why i needed to

'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs, i was there, i remember it all too well, yeah

well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe i asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
running scared, i was there, i remember it all too well

hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
i'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause i remember it all, all, all... too well

time won't fly, it's like i'm paralyzed by it
i'd like to be my old self again, but i'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and i walk home alone

but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'cause there we are again, when i loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare, i was there, i remember it all too well

wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
it was rare, i was there, i remember it all too well

61,22,"

it feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
and make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh.
it feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
to fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh.

yeah,
we're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
it's miserable and magical.
oh, yeah
tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
it's time

uh oh!
i don't know about you
but i'm feeling 22
everything will be alright
if you keep me next to you
you don't know about me
but i'll bet you want to
everything will be alright
if we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh

it seems like one of those nights,
this place is too crowded.
too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's taylor swift anyway, ew?)
it seems like one of those nights,
we ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
instead of sleeping.

yeah,
we're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
it's miserable and magical.
oh, yeah
tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
it's time

uh oh! (hey!)
i don't know about you
but i'm feeling 22
everything will be alright

it feels like one of those nights,
we won't be sleeping.
it feels like one of those nights,
you look like bad news.
i gotta have you,
i gotta have you.

ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh, ye-e-e-e-eah, hey

62,i almost do,"

i bet this time of night you're still up.
i bet you're tired from a long hard week.
i bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
and i bet sometimes you wonder about me.

and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you.
and i wish i could run to you.
and i hope you know that every time i don't
i almost do,
i almost do.

i bet you think i either moved on or hate you
'cause each time you reach out there's no reply.
i bet it never ever occurred to you that i can't say ""hello"" to you
and risk another goodbye.

and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you.
and i wish i could run to you.
and i hope you know that every time i don't
i almost do,
i almost do.

oh, we made quite a mess, babe.
it's probably better off this way.
and i confess, babe,
in my dreams you're touching my face
and asking me if i wanna try again with you.
and i almost do.

and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you.
and i wish i could run to you.
and i hope you know that every time i don't
i almost do,
i almost do.

i bet this time of night you're still up.
i bet you're tired from a long hard week.
i bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
and i hope sometimes you wonder about me.
"
63,we are never ever getting back together,"

i remember when we broke up the first time
saying, ""this is it, i've had enough,"" 'cause like
we hadn't seen each other in a month
when you said you needed space. (what?)
then you come around again and say
""baby, i miss you and i swear i'm gonna change, trust me.""
remember how that lasted for a day?
i say, ""i hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""i love you.""

ooh, we called it off again last night
but ooh, this time i'm telling you, i'm telling you

we are never ever ever getting back together,
we are never ever ever getting back together,
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
but we are never ever ever ever getting back together

like, ever...

i'm really gonna miss you picking fights
and me falling for it screaming that i'm right
and you would hide away and find your peace of mind
with some indie record that's much cooler than mine

ooh, you called me up again tonight
but ooh, this time i'm telling you, i'm telling you

we are never, ever, ever getting back together
we are never, ever, ever getting back together
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
but we are never ever ever ever getting back together

ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
oh oh oh

i used to think that we were forever ever
and i used to say, ""never say never...""
uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, ""i still love you,""
and i'm like... ""i just... i mean this is exhausting, you know, like,
we are never getting back together. like, ever""

no!

we are never ever ever getting back together
we are never ever ever getting back together
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
but we are never ever ever ever getting back together

we, ooh, getting back together, ohhh,
we, ooh, getting back together

you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
but we are never ever ever ever getting back together
"
64,stay stay stay,"

i'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night.
i threw my phone across the room at you.
i was expecting some dramatic turn-away,
but you stayed.

this morning i said we should talk about it.
'cause i read you should never leave a fight unresolved.
that's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, ""okay, let's talk.""

and i said,
stay, stay, stay.
i've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad.
but i think that it's best if we both stay.

before you i'd only dated self-indulgent takers,
who took all of their problems out on me.
but you carry my groceries, and now i'm always laughin'.
and i love you because you have given me no choice but to...

stay, stay, stay.
i've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad.
but i think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay.

you took the time to memorize me:
my fears, my hopes, and dreams.
i just like hangin' out with you all the time.
all those times that you didn't leave;
it's been occurring to me i'd like to hang out with you for my whole life.

stay.
and i'll be loving you for quite some time.
no one else is gonna love me, when i get mad, mad, mad.
so i think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

stay, stay, stay.
i've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad.
but i think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

stay, stay, stay.
i've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad.
but i think that it's best if we both stay.

[background:] that's so fun!
"
65,the last time,"

[gary lightbody:]
i find myself at your door,
just like all those times before,
i'm not sure how i got there,
all roads—they lead me here.

i imagine you are home,
in your room, all alone,
and you open your eyes into mine,
and everything feels better,

[both:]
and right before your eyes,
i'm breaking, no past
no reasons why,
just you and me.

this is the last time i'm asking you this,
put my name at the top of your list,
this is the last time i'm asking you why,
you break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.

[taylor swift:]
you find yourself at my door,
just like all those times before,
you wear your best apology,
but i was there to watch you leave,

and all the times i let you in,
just for you to go again,
disappear when you come back,
everything is better.

[both:]
and right before your eyes,
i'm aching, no past
nowhere to hide,
just you and me...

this is the last time i'm asking you this,
put my name at the top of your list,
this is the last time i'm asking you why,
you break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye...

[taylor swift:] this is the last time you tell me i've got it wrong,
[gary lightbody:] this is the last time i say it's been you all along,
[taylor swift:] this is the last time i let you in my door,
[gary lightbody:] this is the last time, i won't hurt you anymore.

oh, oh, oh,

this is the last time i'm asking you this,
put my name at the top of your list,
this is the last time i'm asking you why,
you break my heart in the blink of an eye.

[4x:]
this is the last time i'm asking you,
last time i'm asking you,
last time i'm asking you this...
"
66,holy ground,"

i was reminiscing just the other day,
while having coffee all alone and lord, it took me away.
back to a first-glance feeling on new york time.
back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme.
took off faster than a green light ""go"".
yeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know.
i left a note on the door with a joke we’d made,
and that was the first day.

and darling, it was good never looking down.
and right there where we stood was holy ground.

spinning like a girl in a brand new dress,
we had this big wide city all to ourselves.
we blocked the noise with the sound of ‘i need you’,
and for the first time i had something to lose,
and i guess we fell apart in the usual way.
and the story’s got dust on every page,
but sometimes i wonder how you think about it now.
and i see your face in every crowd.

cause darling, it was good never looking down.
and right there where we stood was holy ground.

tonight i’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through.
but i don’t wanna dance if i’m not dancing with you.
tonight i’m gonna dance like you were in this room.
but i don’t wanna dance if i’m not dancing with you,

it was good never looking down.
and right there where we stood was holy ground.

tonight i’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through.
but i don’t wanna dance if i’m not dancing with you.
tonight i’m gonna dance like you were in this room.
but i don’t wanna dance if i’m not dancing with you.
"
67,sad beautiful tragic,"

long handwritten note deep in your pocket
words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
i stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair

in dreams i meet you in warm conversation
we both wake in lonely beds, different cities
and time is taking its sweet time erasing you
and you've got your demons, and, darling, they all look like me

'cause we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair

distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
silence, the train runs off its tracks
kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
hang up, give up and for the life of us we can't get back

a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful

and we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair

we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair
"
68,the lucky one,"

new to town with a made up name in the angel's city,
chasing fortune and fame.
and the camera flashes, make it look like a dream.

you had it figured out since you were in school.
everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool.
so overnight you look like a sixties’ queen.

another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky.

and they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
but can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh...

now it’s big black cars, and riviera views,
and your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
and your secrets end up splashed on the news front page.

and they tell you that you’re lucky.
but you’re so confused,
'cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used.
and all the young things line up to take your place.

another name goes up in lights. you wonder if you’ll make it out alive.

and they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.

it was a few years later, i showed up here.
and they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,
how you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.
they say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,
chose the rose garden over madison square,
and it took some time, but i understand it now.

‘cause now my name is up in lights, but i think you got it right,

let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.

yeah they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
and they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
oh, whoa, oh, oh
"
69,everything has changed,"

[taylor swift]
all i knew this morning when i woke
is i know something now, know something now i didn't before.
and all i've seen since eighteen hours ago
is green eyes and freckles and your smile
in the back of my mind making me feel like

[taylor swift]
i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now

[both]
i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
i just wanna know you, know you, know you

[both]
'cause all i know is we said, ""hello.""
and your eyes look like coming home
all i know is a simple name
everything has changed
all i know is you held the door
you'll be mine and i'll be yours
all i know since yesterday is everything has changed

[ed sheeran]
and all my walls stood tall painted blue
and i'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you

[taylor swift (album version) / ed sheeran (remix version):]
and all i feel in my stomach is butterflies
the beautiful kind, making up for lost time,
[album version:] taking flight, making me feel right
[remix version:] taking flight, making me feel right like

[both]
i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
i just wanna know you, know you, know you

i'm feeling like i've missed you all this time, oh, oh, oh.
and meet me there tonight
and let me know that it's not all in my mind.

"
70,starlight,"

i said, ""oh my, what a marvelous tune""
it was the best night, never would forget how we moved.
the whole place was dressed to the nines,
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight
like we're made of starlight

i met bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
picked me up late one night out the window,
we were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
the night we snuck into a yacht club party
pretending to be a duchess and a prince

and i said, ""oh my, what a marvelous tune.""
it was the best night, never would forget how we moved.
the whole place was dressed to the nines,
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we're made of starlight, starlight

he said, ""look at you: worrying too much about things you can't change.
you'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way.""
he was tryna skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me,
""don't you see the starlight, starlight?
don't you dream impossible things?""

like ""oh my, what a marvelous tune.""
it was the best night, never would forget how we moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines,
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we're made of starlight, starlight

ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy
ooh, ooh, dancing with me
ooh, ooh, we could get married
have ten kids and teach them how to dream

oh my, what a marvelous tune
it was the best night, never would forget how we moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines,
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we dream impossible dreams
like starlight, starlight
like we dream impossible dreams
don't you see the starlight, starlight?
don't you dream impossible things?
"
71,begin again,"

took a deep breath in the mirror
he didn't like it when i wore high heels
but i do
turn the lock and put my headphones on
he always said he didn't get this song
but i do, i do

walked in expecting you'd be late
but you got here early and you stand and wave
i walk to you
you pull my chair out and help me in
and you don't know how nice that is
but i do

and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again

you said you never met one girl
who had as many james taylor records as you
but i do
we tell stories and you don't know why
i'm coming off a little shy
but i do

but you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did

i've been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again

and we walked down the block to my car and i almost brought him up
but you start to talk about the movies that your family
watches
every single christmas and i want to talk about that
and for the first time what's past is past

'cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months

thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again

but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
"
72,the moment i knew,"

you should've been there,
should've burst through the door,
with that 'baby i'm right here' smile,
and it would've felt like,
a million little shining stars had just aligned,
and i would've been so happy.

christmas lights glisten,
i've got my eye on the door,
just waiting for you to walk in,
but the time is ticking,
people ask me how i've been
as i comb back through my memory,
how you said you'd be here,
you said you'd be here.

and it was like slow motion,
standing there in my party dress,
in red lipstick,
with no one to impress,
and they're all laughing,
as i'm looking around the room,
but there's one thing missing,
and that was the moment i knew.

and the hours pass by,
now i just wanna be alone,
but your close friends always seem to know
when there's something really wrong,
so they follow me down the hall,
and there in the bathroom,
i try not to fall apart,
and the sinking feeling starts,
as i say hopelessly,
""he said he'd be here.""

and it was like slow motion,
standing there in my party dress,
in red lipstick,
with no one to impress,
and they're all laughing,
and asking me about you,
but there was one thing missing,
and that was the moment i knew.

what do you say
when tears are streaming down your face
in front of everyone you know?
and what do you do when the one
who means the most to you
is the one who didn't show?

you should've been here.
and i would've been so happy.

and it was like slow motion,
standing there in my party dress,
in red lipstick,
with no one to impress,
and they're all standing around me singing
""happy birthday to you"",
but there was one thing missing,
and that was the moment i knew.

ooh, i knew.
ooh,

you called me later,
and said, ""i'm sorry, i didn't make it,""
and i said, ""i'm sorry too,""
and that was the moment i knew.
"
73,come back... be here,"

you said it in a simple way,
4 am, the second day,
how strange that i don't know you at all.
stumbled through the long goodbye,
one last kiss, then catch your flight,
right when i was just about to fall

i told myself, ""don't get attached,""
but in my mind i play it back,
spinning faster than the plane that took you...

and this is when the feeling sinks in,
i don't wanna miss you like this,
come back... be here, come back... be here.
i guess you're in new york today,
i don't wanna need you this way,
come back... be here, come back... be here.

the delicate beginning rush,
the feeling you can know so much,
without knowing anything at all.
and now that i can't put this down,
if i had known what i'd known now,
i never would have played so nonchalant.

taxi cabs and busy streets,
that never bring you back to me,
i can't help but wish you took me with you...

and this is when the feeling sinks in,
i don't wanna miss you like this,
come back... be here, come back... be here.
i guess you're in london today,
i don't wanna need you this way,
come back... be here, come back... be here.

this is falling in love in the cruelest way,
this is falling for you when you are worlds away.

new york... be here.
but you're in london and i break down,
'cause it's not fair that you're not around.

this is when the feeling sinks in,
i don't wanna miss you like this,
come back... be here, come back... be here.
i guess you're in new york today,
and i don't wanna need you this way,
come back... be here, come back... be here.

i don't wanna miss you like this.
come back... be here.
come back... be here.
"
74,girl at home,"

don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that,
uh, uh
don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that.

i don't even know her,
but i feel a responsibility,
to do what's upstanding and right,
it's kinda like a code, yeah,
and you've been getting closer and closer,
and crossing so many lines.

and it would be a fine proposition,
if i was a stupid girl,
but honey i am no-one's exception,
this i have previously learned.

so don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that,
uh, uh
don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that,
i see you turn off your phone,
and now you got me alone,
and i say,
don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that.

i just wanna make sure,
you understand perfectly,
you're the kind of man who makes me sad,
while she waits up,
you chase down the newest thing,
and take for granted what you have.

and it would be a fine proposition,
if i was a stupid girl,
and yeah i might go with it,
if i hadn't once been just like her.

don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that,
uh, uh
don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that,
i see you turn off your phone,
and now you've got me alone,
and i say,
don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that.

call a cab,
lose my number,
you're about to lose your girl,
call a cab,
lose my number,
let's consider this lesson learned.

don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that,
uh, uh
don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that,
wanna see you pick up your phone,
and tell her you're coming home,
don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that,
uh, uh
don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that.

it would be a fine proposition,
if i hadn't once been just like her.

""oh my god, who is she?""
i get drunk on jealousy
but you'll come back each time you leave
'cause, darling, i'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

looking at it now
it all seems so simple
we were lying on your couch
i remember
you took a polaroid of us
then discovered (then discovered)
the rest of the world was black and white
but we were in screaming color
and i remember thinking…

are we in the clear yet?
are we in the clear yet?

are we out of the woods?

looking at it now
last december (last december)
we were built to fall apart
then fall back together (back together)
your necklace hanging from my neck
the night we couldn't quite forget
when we decided (we decided)
to move the furniture so we could dance,
baby, like we stood a chance
two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
and i remember thinkin'

[2x:]
are we out of the woods yet?

remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
twenty stitches in the hospital room
when you started cryin', baby, i did, too
but when the sun came up, i was lookin' at you
remember when we couldn't take the heat
i walked out and said, ""i'm settin' you free,""
but the monsters turned out to be just trees
and when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me

you were lookin' at me
you were lookin' at me,
i remember, oh, i remember

this love is alive back from the dead
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me

tossing, turning, struggled through the night with someone new
and i could go on and on, on and on
lantern burning, flickered in my mind for only you
but you're still gone, gone, gone

been losing grip,
on sinking ships

the drought was the very worst
when the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
it was months and months of back and forth
you're still all over me like a wine-stained dress i can't wear anymore

hung my head as i lost the war
and the sky turned black like a perfect storm

rain came pouring down when i was drowning
that's when i could finally breathe
and by morning gone was any trace of you,
i think i am finally clean

there was nothing left to do
when the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
so i punched a hole in the roof
let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

the water filled my lungs
i screamed so loud but no one heard a thing

rain came pouring down when i was drowning
that's when i could finally breathe
and by morning gone was any trace of you,
i think i am finally clean
i think i am finally clean
said i think i am finally clean

10 months sober, i must admit
just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
10 months older, i won't give in
now that i'm clean i'm never gonna risk it

the drought was the very worst
when the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

you held on tight to me

i'm spinning out of control.

didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?

oh

didn't it all seem new and exciting?
i felt your arms twisting around me
i should have slept with one eye open at night.

too in love to think straight
all alone or so it seemed.

but there were strangers watching
and whispers turned to talking
and talking turned to screams.

oh

didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
didn't you calm my fears with a cheshire cat smile?

oh

didn't it all seem new and exciting?
i felt your arms twisting around me
it's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind.

but darling, we found wonderland

one look, dark room
meant just for you
time moved too fast
you play it back
buttons on a coat
lighthearted joke
no proof, not much
but you saw enough
small talk, he drives
coffee at midnight
the light reflects
the chain on your neck
he says, ""look up.""
and your shoulders brush
no proof, one touch
but you felt enough

you can hear it in the silence, silence
you can feel it on the way home, way home
you could see it with the lights out, lights out
you are in love, true love
you are in love

morning, his place
burnt toast, sunday
you keep his shirt
he keeps his word
and for once you let go
of your fears and your ghosts
one step, not much
but it said enough
you kiss on sidewalks
you fight then you talk
one night he wakes
strange look on his face
pauses, then says.
""you're my best friend.""
and you knew what it was
he is in love

you can hear it in the silence, silence
you can feel it on the way home, way home
you could see it with the lights out, lights out
you are in love, true love

and so it goes
you two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round
and he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
and you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
and why i spent my whole life trying to put it into words

'cause you can hear it in the silence
you can feel it on the way home
you could see it with the lights out
you are in love, true love
you're in love

you can hear it in the silence, silence
you can feel it on the way home, way home
you could see it with the lights out, lights out
you are in love, true love
you're in love

you can hear it in the silence, silence
you can feel it on the way home, way home
you can see it with the lights out, lights out
you are in love, true love
you're in love

and i know those fans out there, are just all in""

we're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
we wait for trains that just aren't coming
we show off our different scarlet letters
trust me, mine is better

we're so young but we're on the road to ruin
we play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing
we cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
honey, life is just a classroom

'cause, baby, i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and every day is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream

baby, we're the new romantics
come on, come along with me
heart break is the national anthem
we sing it proudly
we are too busy dancing
to get knocked off our feet
baby, we're the new romantics
the best people in life are free

we're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
we hang back, it's all in the timing
it's poker, he can't see it in my face
but i'm about to play my ace

we need love, but all we want is danger
we team up then switch sides like a record changer
the rumors are terrible and cruel
but, honey, most of them are true

'cause, baby, i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and every day is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream

baby, we're the new romantics
come on, come along with me
heart break is the national anthem
we sing it proudly
we are too busy dancing
to get knocked off our feet
baby, we're the new romantics
the best people in life are free

so come on, come along with me
the best people in life are free

please take my hand and
please take me dancing and
please leave me stranded
it's so romantic

[music video version:]
""i don't want to forget anything that happened on this tour
it was one of those remarkable moments in time when everything felt exciting""

knew he was a killer
first time that i saw him
wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted
but if he's a ghost then i can be a phantom
holdin' him for ransom
some, some boys are tryin' too hard
he don't try at all though
younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
i see nothing better, i keep him forever
like a vendetta-ta

i-i-i see how this is gonna go
touch me, and you'll never be alone

you should see the things we do, baby

i know i'm gonna be with you
so i take my time
(are you ready for it?)

knew i was a robber
first time that he saw me
stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
but if i'm a thief then
he can join the heist
and we'll move to an island-and
and he can be my jailer
burton to this taylor
every love i've known in comparison is a failure
i forget their names now
i'm so very tame now
never be the same now, now

[ed sheeran:]
knew her when i was young
reconnected when we were little bit older, both sprung
i got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
reputation precedes me; in rumors i’m knee-deep
the truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
and you understand the good and bad end up in a song
for all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
for all my flaws, paranoia and insecurities
i've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
after the storm, something was born on the 4th of july
i've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
with four words on the tip of my tongue, i'll never say it

[taylor swift:]
i don't wanna touch you, i don't wanna be
just another ex-love you don't wanna see

[taylor swift:]
i hit you like bang
we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
and i bury hatchets, but i keep maps of where i put 'em
reputation precedes me, they told you i'm crazy
i swear i don't love the drama, it loves me
and i can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
it's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
you've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
so here's the truth from my red lips

so i fly 'em all around the world
and i let them think they saved me

they never see it comin', what i do next
this is how the world works
you gotta leave before you get left

i can feel the flames on my skin
he says, ""don't throw away a good thing.""
but if he drops my name
then i owe him nothin'
and if he spends my change
then he had it comin'

they say i did something bad
then why's it feel so good?
they say i did something bad
but why's it feel so good?

in shades of gray and candlelight
i wanted to leave him
i needed a reason

x marks the spot, where we fell apart
he poisoned the well, i was lying to myself
i knew it from the first old fashioned, we were cursed
we never had a shotgun shot in the dark

you were driving the getaway car
we were flying, but we'd never get far
don't pretend it's such a mystery
think about the place where you first met me
we're riding in a getaway car
there were sirens in the beat of your heart
should've known i'd be the first to leave
think about the place where you first met me
in a getaway car
no, they never get far
no, nothing good starts in a getaway car

it was the great escape, the prison break
the light of freedom on my face
but you weren't thinking
and i was just drinking
well he was running after us, i was screaming 'go go go!'
but with three of us, honey, it's a side show
and a circus ain't a love story
and now we're both sorry (we're both sorry)

no, nothing good starts in a getaway car

we were jet set bonnie and clyde
until i switched to the other side
it's no surprise, i turned you in
'cause us traitors never win

i'm in a getaway car
i left you in the motel bar
i put the money in a bag and stole the keys
that was the last time you ever saw me
